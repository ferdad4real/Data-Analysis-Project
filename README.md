# Company XYZ Supermarket Q1 Business Data Analysis

This project is focused on performing a detailed analysis of the business data of the three supermarket branches owned by Company XYZ at different locations in Abuja, Lagos and Port Harcourt for the first quarter of the year 2019.

# Project Steps

The first step in this project is to understand the type and the nature of the data in order to ensure an adequate and accurate analysis. The data for each location were combined to generate a global dataset which was analysed. The data in each column were converted to standard forms, and the summary statistical attributes were determined. The data was then explored to identify trends toward developing a comparative analysis of the branches and generating useful insights. Finally, various visualisations were generated in the form of figures to enable an in-depth understanding of the dataset..

# Insights

The dataset was well collected as there is no case of missing data, and it revealed that a total of 1000 sales were made across the three branches for the 3-month period, with 342 in Lagos, 332 in Abuja and 328 in Port Harcourt. The highest total single sale of ₦375,354.00 and a minimum of ₦3,844.26. Epay is the most used means of payment with 345 transactions, followed by cash payment with 344 and card payment with 311 transactions. Also, the minimum customer satisfaction rating is 4, and the maximum is 10, with an average value of 6.97. Branch B has the lowest customer satisfaction rating. The mean unit price is ₦20,041.97, while the mean of the gross income is ₦5,536.57. The standard deviation of the gross margin percentage is 0, which implies that the values are constant, i.e., at 4.76%.

The total cost of goods sold for Abuja is ₦36,410,630.40 with a gross income of ₦1,820,531.52, and ₦36,411,555.60 for Lagos with a gross income of ₦1,820,577.78, and ₦37,909,270.80 for Port Harcourt with the highest gross income of ₦1,895,463.54. Regarding the total number of transactions, for the three branches, Fashion Accessories is the highest product line while Health and Beauty is the lowest.

Fashion Accessories with a high average unit price has the lowest average quantity sold per transaction, while Electronic Accessories with the lowest unit price has the highest average quantity sold per transaction. The other products are in between the two extremes, and this indicates that unit price has a major impact on the quantity of goods purchased by customers.

In terms of income, Food and beverages generated the highest gross income of ₦962,483.04, while Health and beauty had the lowest gross income of ₦843,321.24.


# Future Work

To further make this project more robust in the future, it will be productive for the dataset to uniquely identify all member customers toward conducting an annual analysis to determine customer churn rate. Also, a questionnaire can be used to get categorised customer feedback regarding any aspect of the supermarkets' operation they do not like. Also, regression models can be developed to further understand the relationships between the variables.


# Standout Section

The total income, cost of goods sold and gross income per product line was computed.
A new variable gross margin was computed using the given gross margin percentage as a percentage of the cost of goods sold. From the computation, Port Harcourt had the highest gross margin of ₦1,805,203.37. The gross margin variation for the three cities was presented using a violin plot. Finally, an analysis of the gross margin for each city per product line was generated and presented in a figure.
